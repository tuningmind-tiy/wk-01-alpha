Description

Grouping HTML elements and working with layouts in CSS are two of the most important skills to learn. This assignment tests both of these skills.

Today you're going to finish your "wk-01-alpha" project.

Add a new "tasks-day3.md" file with the following tasks and then complete those tasks. (Remember to make small and frequent commits ðŸ˜‰!)
_**All Wizarding Levels**_

ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS (and other notes)
- You _may not_ use libraries, modules, extensions, plug-ins, or frameworks.
- You _may_ use any CSS3 element except those related to flexbox.
- You _must_ use float.
- The final design _must_ be responsive down to 900px (i.e. it does not need to go below 900px)
- You do not need to keep any of the styling from yesterday's assignment.  Keep what you want, change what you want.
****
Ensure that you:
- [x] Use a **header** element to contain:
  - [x] A **page title** in the appropriate element
  - [x] A **navigation bar** broken into two sub-groupings
    - [x] The left grouping in the navigation bar needs:
      - [x] to be an unordered list of two or more items
      - [x] in each list item should have a styled link  (e.g. a link to an internal id, a link to a second page, and a link to an additional resources page)
      - [x] the list items should be aligned horizontally _and_ without bullets
    - [x] The right grouping has one or two buttons (e.g. a link to a non-existent log-in, and a link to a non-existent profile page)
- [x] Use the **main** element to contain your main content.
- [x] Use div elements to divide your content up into 5 logical groups which will be referred to as **cards**.
- [x] Position your cards so there are 3 cards in a top row and 2 in the bottom row (e.g. 3 columns).  _Do **not** use a table to position your cards!_
- [x] Use a footer element to display your personal information (e.g. your name, a link to your github profile, links to any of your social media forms, etc.).  Ensure your personal information is centered in the footer.

- Make
  - [x] small and frequent git commits
  - [x] with messages following the basic AngularJS Git Commit Msg Convention style (per [Git Commit Messages](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html))
- [x] Ensure you've set the GitHub pages to use your "master branch".
