Due: Tue, February 28th
Path: Front End Engineering - Salt Lake City - 2017 Spring  Unit: Assignments
Description: Basic, non-positional, styling of yesterday's assignment.

Today you're going to start styling your "wk-01-alpha" project from yesterday. We didn't cover anything related to position, but you can start to do other styling without positioning.

Add a new "tasks-day2.md" file with the following tasks and then complete those tasks. (Remember to make small and frequent commits :wink:!)
_**All Wizardering Levels**_
Without worrying about positioning, have fun styling your "wk-01-alpha" project, just ensure that you:
- [x] Include css in each of the three possible ways: imported, style element, embedded.
- Apply styles based on the following selectors and selector combinations:
 - [x] element
 - [x] class
 - [x] id
 - [x] distinct nested element and class combination (i.e. if applied to element
 - [x] distinct nested element and class combination (i.e. if applied to element _or_ class _alone_ then additional nodes would be also be styled;  e.g. `p a`)
 - [x] shared styles (e.g. `p, a`)
- Add styling including at least one instance for each of these **properties**:
 - [x] width
 - [x] height
 - [x] display
 - [x] margin
 - [x] padding
 - [x] border
 - [x] border-radius
 - [x] background-color
 - [x] background-image
 - [x] color
 - [x] font-size
 - [x] font-style
 - [x] text-align
 - [x] font-weight
 - [x] text-decoration
- Use the following measurements at least once:
 - [x] px
 - [x] %
 - [x] rem
 - [x] em
- [x] Modify each of the four different anchor states
- Make
 - [x] small and frequent git commits
 - [x] with messages following the basic AngularJS Git Commit Msg Convention style (per [Git Commit Messages](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html))
- [x] Ensure you've set the GitHub pages to use your "master branch".

_**Skilled Sorcerers**_

- [x] Use a background gradiant
- [ ] Add and style a table with appropriate content (i.e. tabular data)

_**Wise Wizards**_

- [ ] Use `data-[prefix]` with `attr(data-[prefix])` function  (you'll need to do some research into the [data attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes))

****

_**EVERYONE**_

- [ ] Ensure you submit both the GitHub repo url (e.g. https://github.com/[username]-tiy/wk-01-alpha) as your "Assignment URL" _and_ the GitHub pages url (e.g. https://[username]-tiy.github.io/wk-01-alpha) in the notes area.

Using data attributes
HTML5 is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning. data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or Node.setUserData().
